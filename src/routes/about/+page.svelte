			>"The Tarot is a pack of seventy-eight cards. There are four suits,
			as in modern playing cards, which are derived from it. But the Court
			cards number four instead of three. In addition, there are
			twenty-two cards called 'Trumps', each of which is a symbolic
			picture with a title itself. At first sight one would suppose this
			arrangement to be arbitrary, but it is not. It is necessitated, as
			will appear later, by the structure of the universe, and in
			particular of the Solar System, as symbolized by the Holy Qabalah."</i

			>"The role of the church is to curate experience and interaction
			with the unconscious in a way that does not drive you made or make
			you die, which is what happens most of the time when people deal
			with the unconscious on their own. You will go mad, and you will
			die. This does happen with tarot, of course [...] This is why I
			believe in a curated scientific approach to tarot [...] a trapped
			spirit is like a loaded handgun left in a room with toddlers. Tarot
			can be like that. Tarot can be very dangerous: you can go crazy."</i

	<h2>Historical and Esoteric Roots</h2>

	<p>
		Tarot first appeared in 15th-century Italy as a card game <i
			>(trionfi)</i
		>, but by the 18th and 19th centuries was adapted for occult and
		esoteric use by groups such as the French occultists and the Hermetic
		Order of the Golden Dawn. These systems connected tarot to:
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Astrology:</strong> Cards correspond to planets, zodiac signs, and
		elements. This can also be found in the Rosicrucian symbol of the Rosy Cross.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Kabbalah/Qabbalah:</strong> The Major Arcana map to the 22 paths
		of the Tree of Life and each have Hebrew letter correspondences.
	</p>

	<p>
		As far as history tells, tarot is not as old as the Egyptian or
		Babylonian mystery traditions (although some have made this claim). This
		said, it has, at the very least, absorbed their ancient symbolic
		systems, becoming a kind of living book of perennial wisdom.
	</p>

	<p>But only for those who can read the symbols.</p>
	<h2>Correspondences</h2>

	<div class="note">

			>Daniel Tarr's Tarot Correspondences</a
		> as well as our list of suggested reading/resources.
	</div>

	<p>
		Each tarot card has multiple layers of meaning. This app will show you
		the following correspondences when you select a card:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Card Name</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Original Golden Dawn Title</strong></li>
		<li>
			<strong>Original Esoteric Title:</strong> Title given to the card by
			the Golden Dawn
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Astrological or Elemental Attribution:</strong> The symbol(s)
			which frame the energy of the card
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Hebrew Letter & Letter Association:</strong> Each Major Arcana
			card corresponds to a Hebrew letter and its symbolic meaning (e.g., Aleph
			= Ox, Beth = House)
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Part of Soul:</strong> The level of the psyche or soul the card
			touches (from the perspective of Kabbalah)
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Suit and Element (for Minor Arcana):</strong> The suit indicates
			the domain of life (e.g., Wands = creativity and will, Cups = emotions).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Division of Creation:</strong> The Qabalistic world associated
			with the card (Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, Assiah).
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Tree of Life Path or Sefira:</strong> Shows where the card sits
			on the Kabbalistic Tree of Life—either a path connecting two sefirot
			(as in the case of the Major Arcana) or a sefira itself (as in the case
			of the minor arcana). For a more comprehensive understanding of the Tree
			of Life.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Dates/Degrees of the Zodiac:</strong> In the case of the court
			cards, there are date-ranges the card corresponds to.
		</li>

		With diligent study of the symbols at hand, you can engage with each
		card in a more accessible way than ever before. However, we strongly
		would like to encourage the user not to use this convenience as a
		substitute for real tarot readings with physical decks.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the case of the serious magickal practitioner, we recommend a
		thorough memorization and understanding of the material at hand and long
		term study of each card, one at a time, day by day. This all being said,
